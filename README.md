## Game Plot -
In this game, there's this greedy man who wants to collect coins, through out his way. Remember, he is greedy there's no limit for him. But, in his way there are some bombs laid out for him. You have to help this man to collect as many coins as he can and ditch all the bombs because once you hit them he gets all dizzy(like 5th pic) and the game is over.
You can view your coins count on the top left corner.And your highest collection in this run on the top right corner in red. 
You have to tap on the screen to jump.You can tap as many times as you want it all adds up to his jump.
While falling he first falls slowly and then faster, to make it look like real gravity=)
